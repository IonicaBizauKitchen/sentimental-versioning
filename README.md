# sentimental-versioning

## Version One dot Oh

Some version number systems aspire to merely labling the changes
in an interface, but there is so much in the human experience
that lies outside that realm. Sometimes a version is a number,
but sometimes what we want is a really a _poem_.

Semver has a spec, but Sentimental Versioning has not a spec,
but a guide; some suggestions. If you use sentimental versioning
you *should not* copy another sentimental versioning system,
you *should* do something creative and original. You *may*
explain your system you use, if it enhances the meaning of
your system. You may just improvise new numbers from your mood
on that day. The only important thing, is that the version
number is meaningful to you, the author.

## Inspiration

Here are some projects that use sentimental versioning,
draw inspiration from the way their version numbers
express intangible aspects of the project.

### Node.js, by Ryan Dahl

node.js is like a rebelious teenager. It skips class
and plays in a punk rock band - yet still gets straight A's.
And it's versioning system expresses it's dual nature
bueatifully. Version numbers alternate between even and odd,
and between stable and unstable. In unstable versions
node makes it's own rules and sticks it to the man. In stable
versions node wears a long sleave shirt over it's tattoos
and works at fortune 500 companies, fighting the system from
the inside. Some critics say that node is part of the
establishment now, citing that it's been a very long time
since it's last album was released, version `0.12` having
been in the works for over a year. While this accusation
may carry some weight, you cannot put a time frame on
creativity, and you must admit that node's use of sentimental
versioning is an expression of it's own internal conflicts.

### Backbone, by Jeremy Ashkenas

Jeremy calls his versioning system
[romantic](https://github.com/jashkenas/backbone/issues/2888#issuecomment-29076249)
(which is _very_ sentimental of him)
It looks like semver (`major.minor.patch`), but with
a personal meaning. For him, a patch is a change you
probably won't notice, and a minor change is when you
change it a little bit. A major change is when you make
a major release. (notice the circular defitinion!)
a major change can be anything or nothing. He says
every change _should_ be backwards compatible. But what
does "backwards compatible" mean to Jeremy? That is
up to you to decide. Jeremy's use of sentimental versioning
expresses how backbone is his masterpeice, and he, it's master.

### TeX and METAFONT, by Donald Knuth

In his seminal text layout system, TeX, and his equally
brilliant typeface design system, METAFONT, Donald uses
a versioning number system that asymtotically approaches
perfection. The version numbers of TeX approach `pi`
(currently version 3.14159265) and the version numbers of
METAFONT approach `e`. It has been prophesized that the
last change not be made until after the day Donald ascends
to heaven on a shining cloud. At that point, donald will
make one last ssh connection down from heaven to his server at
Stanford University and set the version number unto `pi`
_exactly_. At that point all remaning bugs will be declared
features, and the output from TeX will remain the same
for all eternity.
